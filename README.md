# FoodPantryApp
An application that aids in the management of Portland Community Collegeâ€™s food pantry and efficient outreach to food insecure students. The development process followed the Agile Framework and was driven by the stories provided by the product owner. Worked in a team of four to write code in Java and utilized SQL server to successfully deliver requirements for each sprint as well as performed agile ceremonies such as stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospective. Demonstrated the product at the end of each sprint to receive feedback from the product owner and improve the application accordingly.
My main role was to create a Template form for different college events and occassions so that the staffs at the college could send notifications to subscribers by filling out a simple form.
