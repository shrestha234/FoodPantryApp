# FoodPantryApp
An application that aids in the management of Portland Community Collegeâ€™s food pantry and efficient outreach to food insecure students. The development process followed the Agile Framework and was driven by the stories provided by the product owner. Worked in a team of four to write code in Java and utilized SQL server to successfully deliver requirements for each sprint as well as performed agile ceremonies such as stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospective. Demonstrated the product at the end of each sprint to receive feedback from the product owner and improve the application accordingly.
